#  Real-Time AI-Powered Object Detection

This project is a web-based AI tool for real-time object detection and identification using the YOLOv8 neural network model. It allows users to either upload an image or use their webcam to detect objects in real-time. The system is designed for developers, AI enthusiasts, and researchers interested in applying deep learning to practical computer vision tasks.

##  Features

-  Upload an image and detect objects using AI.
-  Use webcam for real-time object detection.
-  Powered by YOLOv8 — a state-of-the-art deep learning model.
-  Streamlit-based user interface for ease of use.
-  Fast, accurate, and lightweight object detection.
